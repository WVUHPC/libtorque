A set of scripts and classes to build torque submitfilters.  


This is currently in production as /shared/repos/torque_filter.  In the branch 
refactor-qsub; there is a refactored much more heavy object decomposition 
version of this script; however it's not fully functional.  There isn't a full 
need to finish this or upgrade this script unless you need more functionality.

On the server, there is a service script (submitfilter) that can start/stop 
this service as a qsub filter.  That documents how this gets into production.
